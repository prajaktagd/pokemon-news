      <p>Casual trekkers along the Pacific Coast Highway have discovered 3 new
        species of Pokemon. These species had previously only been theorised and
        this is the first time that any human has seen these in the wild.
        Initial reports suggest that these pokemon are not particularly
        dangerous and appear quite friendly to humans. They seem especially fond
        of candy. One of the trekkers who first spotted Bulbasaur said:</p>
      <blockquote>This is one of the cutest Pokemon we've ever seen. We could
        not believe we saw something like this. This is the happiest day of my
        life.</blockquote>
      <p>Researchers are elated and cannot wait to find more such hidden
        Pokemon. Some researchers believe over 200 such species exist in the
        wild.</p>
